# Intro to DirectX Raytracing

This repository is the code for the three part article serie called 'Intro to DirectX Raytracing' by Niels Jaspers.

## How to use

### Command line arguments
- `-validation`: Enables the validation layers.
- `-console`: Opens a console window as a logger.
- `-warp`: Use Microsoft's software renderer for the rendering, rather than the dedicated GPU. This would be useful to ensure that the DirectX API gets used properly, and use features that are not available for your GPU.
